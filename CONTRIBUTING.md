# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing to this project!

The main goal you must follow is **to write clean code!**

## Code Style

- **Indentation**: Use 4 spaces for indentation.

- **Naming Conventions**: Use snake_case for variables and functions, and PascalCase for classes.

- **Function Length**: Keep functions short and focused.

- **Whitespace**: Use whitespaces to improve code readability.

That's all!
