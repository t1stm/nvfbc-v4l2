# Security Policy

The security principles in this project are fairly basic.
Always try to run the latest release, because I am not going to support old releases of this project. I'll try to keep this project backwards-compatible with previous syntaxes, but I can't promise anything.

If some security vulnerability occurs in this project, I'll do my best to fix it in time, but at the same time, I doubt that anything will happen to a small project like this.
